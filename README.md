What is it for?
------------

It's a tool to get browser details from clients, bug reporters... in a simple way.

####There are three possibilities to use it:

1. Send Link to http://bugspencer.com/bugreporter to your bug reporter and ask them to send you back the details via email or twitter

2. Clone https://github.com/justmarkup/bugreporter, change styles and wording as you like and upload it to your server (you can also use github pages if you like). Send link to http://[your-server-name]/bugreporter to your bug reporter and ask them to send you back the details via email or twitter

3. Clone https://github.com/justmarkup/bugreporter, change the following variables in email/index.html

```
var mandrillkey = 'YOUR_MANDRILL_KEY'; // You need a mandrill account https://mandrill.com/ (free for up to 12k emails a month)
	emailTo = 'YOUR_EMAIL_ADRESS',
	emailName = 'YOUR_NAME',
	clientReference = 'YOUR_CLIENT';
```

Upload everything to sour server. After that you can send a link to http://[your-server-name]/bugreporter/email to your bug reporter and you will immediately a email back with her/his details.
